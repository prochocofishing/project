  "hero.subtitle": "Great stories begin with a simple idea... ours was no different. It started with a deep passion for the sea and the craft of fishing. We believed, with unwavering conviction, that we could turn that love into something greater: creating high-quality fishing gear built to withstand hard use, serve those who live the sea and above all be truly effective. Armed with know‑how, the best materials and relentless dedication, we took on the challenge. What began as a simple passion became a mission, and a great story that keeps growing.",
